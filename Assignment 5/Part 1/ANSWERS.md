For this assignment, I made a file with test cases for the snakes and ladders game from assignment 1.

deleted sum code that was not needed in the main game (protected int points to in suqare)
in gameboard public Queue<Player> getPlayers() {return list_of_players;}

gameboard init not int = crash --> fixed
