To run the game please run mainClass.

Our variant sends players that land on an occupied field back to the first field. 
It also sends a player backwards if he overshoots the last square, meaning that he must reach the last square by rolling the die,
so that he moves directly into it. If he has steps left when reaching the last square he moves backwards the remaining steps.
